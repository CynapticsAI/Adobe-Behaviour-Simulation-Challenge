# Task 2

## Steps for predicting

In this task, you have to download the three notebooks, provided in the Task 2 folder in the Notebooks folder, and the steps are as follows:

- Using the media captions generator notebook to generate the captions of the media present in the dataset. (For the test data, captions are provided [here](../../Dataset/Testing%20Data/) under the names cc_captions for content generation for unseen company and ct_captions for content generation for unseen time period, as captions for the first task was not necessary)

- Combine the generated captions with the give data, to make a final file. (For the given data, cstc and cstt are the two file for conetnt generation for unseen company and time respectively, which are provided [here](../../Dataset/Testing%20Data/))

- Fine tune the LlaMA-2 model using the LLaMA finetuning notebook to finetune the LlaMA model for our task.

- Using the final inference notebook, get the final generated tweets for this task.
